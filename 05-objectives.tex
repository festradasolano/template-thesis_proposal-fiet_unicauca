\section{Objectives}
\label{sec:objectives}

This section must indicate in a very precise way what is the purpose of the work and show a clear and consistent relationship to the problem description and, particularly, to the questions to solve.

It is recommended to formulate a global, general objective, coherent with the stated problem, and two or more specific objectives that will lead to achieving the general objective and that are reachable using the proposed methodology.

The objectives must answer at least one of the following questions: What knowledge is expected to generate? What solution to a specific problem is expected to be achieved from a scientific, technological, and methodological perspective? This is, what is the contribution that will be achieved with the development of the project?

Recall that objectives must not be confused with activities or methodological procedures.

\subsection{General Objective}

Define here the general objective.

\subsection{Specific Objectives}

\begin{itemize}
    \item First specific objective.
    
    \item Second specific objective.
    
    \item Third specific objective.
