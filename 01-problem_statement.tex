\section{Problem statement}
\label{sec:problem_statement}

In the study problem definition, it is fundamental to clearly identify the research question(s) to solve and the particular problem(s) whose solution or understanding will contribute to the execution of the research project. Therefore, it is recommended to make a precise and complete description of the problem nature and magnitude and justify the research need in terms of the country development and/or the contribution to the global scientific knowledge. This item must clearly answer the following question: Why this project must be carried out? Take into account that the expected solution of the problem must not be exposed.
